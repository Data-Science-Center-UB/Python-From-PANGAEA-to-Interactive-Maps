# Python: From PANGAEA to Interactive Maps

This repository offers hands-on, self-learning notebooks that demonstrate Python workflows for visualizing geospatial data from PANGAEA (Data Publisher for Earth & Environmental Science). It contains three notebooks: retrieving data via the PANGAEA API, preprocessing the data, and visualizing the results. The notebooks build upon each other and are intended to be completed in order.

The repository consists of:

/Notebooks_Exercises (Jupyter notebooks including unsolved exercises) <br>
/Notebooks_Solutions (Jupyter notebooks including exercises with solutions) <br>
/Images (images loaded in the Jupyter notebooks) <br>
/Data (datasets downloaded and loaded in the Jupyter notebooks) <br>
/Plots (visualizations created in the Jupyter notebooks)

>About the project
>
>This repository was developed and delivered as part of workshops within the framework of the DataNord project at the Data Science Center of the University of Bremen. The DataNord project is funded under the grant number 16DKZ2026A by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) >and financed by the European Union – NextGenerationEU. It is part of a broader initiative to strengthen data literacy among researchers by offering practical, hands-on training in core areas of 1) data science, 2) research data management (RDM), 3) critical thinking, and 4) ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA). The materials were developed by Annika Nolte and Sarah Büker.
